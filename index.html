    <h1> Hello! My name is Anice!</h1>
    <h4> I am a computer science major graduating with my bachelor's in May 2025!</h4>
    <p> It is my goal to recieve my master's in Game Design. I hope to one day work for a game company and eventually branch off and create my own games. <br />
    I have a high interest in creating 2D games, but also would love to create 3D and virtual reality games as well.</p>

    <h2> Current Projects: </h2>
    <p>I am currently working on a 2D pixel art game. I am using the Godot game engine to create it. All pixel art by me is being drawn in Pixel Studio.<br />
      The game is still fairly early in development, however here are some game sprites:</p>
    <p><b>Main Character:</b></p>
    <p>This is the sprite sheet for the player character, Eni: </p>
    <img src="images/Eni Sprite Sheet.png" alt="Eni Sprite Sheet" style= "height:500px;"/>
    <p>This sprite sheet contains the walking sprites, the idle sprites, and idle/moving sprites that will be used when the player has a torch equipped. <br />
    As the game further develops, more actions will be added to this sheet.</p>
    <p><b>Spider Enemy:</b></p>
    <p>This is a concept for a simple spider enemy.</p>
    <img src="images/Spider Minion Sprite Sheet.png" alt= "Spider Minion" style="height:500px;"/>
