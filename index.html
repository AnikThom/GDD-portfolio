    <h4> I am a computer science major at Troy Universuty graduating with my bachelor's in May 2025!</h4>
    <p> It is my goal to recieve my master's in Game Design. I hope to one day work for a game company and eventually branch off and create my own games. <br />
    I have a high interest in creating 2D games, but also would love to create 3D and virtual reality games as well.</p>
