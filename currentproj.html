    <h1>Current Work </h1>
    <hr>
    <p>I am currently working on a 2D pixel art game. I am using the Godot game engine to create it. All pixel art by me is being drawn in Pixel Studio.<br />
      The game is still fairly early in development.</p>
    <div class="imgdisplay">
    <p><b>Main Character:</b></p>
    <p>This is the sprite sheet for the player character, Eni: </p>
    <div class= "centerimg"><img src="images/Eni Sprite Sheet.png" alt="Eni Sprite Sheet" style= "height:500px;"/></div>
    <p>This sprite sheet contains the walking sprites, the idle sprites, and idle/moving sprites that will be used when the player has a torch equipped. <br />
    As the game further develops, more actions will be added to this sheet.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="imgdisplay">
    <p><b>Spider Enemy:</b></p>
    <p>This is a concept for a simple spider enemy.</p>
    <div class="centerimg"><img src="images/Spider Minion Sprite Sheet.png" alt= "Spider Minion" style="height:500px;"/></div>
    <p>Here is a concept for a useable item once the player defeats the spider enemy. The player will be able to use this to unlock hidden areas.</p>
    <div class="centerimg"><img src ="images/Bomb Sprite.png" alt="Bomb Item" style="height:250px;"/></div>
